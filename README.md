# Monument to my Stupidity
This repo is a monument to my stupidity. It contains various solutions to problems I caused throughout my years as a developer.

I hope that you may divine some wisdom from my errors. If you have unintentionally caused the issue yourself, I sympathize with you greatly.

This repo is not maintained in any meaningful way and will only be updated once I have another severe relapse in judgement.
